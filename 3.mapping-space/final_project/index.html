                <p class="explanation">
                    Induced seismicity refers to seismic events, usually earthquakes caused partially or completely by anthropogenic activities. Human-induced earthquakes have become an important topic of political and scientific discussion, owing to the concern that these events may be responsible for widespread damage and an overall increase in seismicity.
